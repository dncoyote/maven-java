### **HTTP Requests**
 - HTTP is the protocol used by web browsers and servers to communicate and exchange information. 
 - An HTTP request is a message sent by a client, typically a web browser or an application, to request data from a server.
 - HTTP request typically consists of the following components:
   - HTTP Method: This indicates the type of request being made, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Each HTTP method has a specific purpose, such as retrieving data (GET), submitting data (POST), updating data (PUT), or deleting data (DELETE).
   - URL (Uniform Resource Locator): This specifies the web address of the resource being requested. It includes the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), the domain name (e.g., www.example.com), and the path to the resource (e.g., /images/pic.jpg).
   - Headers: These are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request, such as the type of data being sent, the language preference, caching settings, and more. Headers are used to convey meta-information about the request to the server.
   - Body (optional): This is the data, such as form data or JSON, that is sent as part of the request. It is typically used in POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to send data to the server.

 - Once the HTTP request is sent to the server, the server processes the request and generates an HTTP response, which is sent back to the client with the requested data. The response typically contains a response status code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.), headers with additional information, and optionally, a response body with the requested data.
